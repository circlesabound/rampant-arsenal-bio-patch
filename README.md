# Rampant Arsenal - bio weapon patch

This mod nerfs the insanely overpowered bio-weapons and ammunition from Rampant Arsenal, rebalancing bio weaponry with a hybrid crowd-control and damage-over-time focus.

Toxic clouds themselves have had their direct damage from being inside the cloud heavily reduced.

The persistent poison damage-over-time applied when inside a toxic cloud or applied directly from bio ammunition has had its total damage slightly reduced, but the duration over which it is applied is significantly increased, and the strength of the movement speed slow has been intensified.
